// programming language - it is a set of rules and syntax to write a program in a particular language
// compiler - it is a program that takes a program written in a programming language and converts it into a format that can be executed by the computer (in our case a binary file)
// interpreter - it is a program that takes a program written in a programming language and executes it line by line
// low-level-language - it is a programming language that is closer to machine language than human language
// c++ - it is a programming language, it is a compiled language, it follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, it is a general-purpose programming language
// high-level-language - it is a programming language that is easy to read and write, it is closer to human language than machine language



// c++ boilerplate
#include <iostream> // iostream - it is a header file, it is used to perform input and output operations
using namespace std; // std - it is a namespace, it is used to define standard names 
// namespace - it is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc.) inside it
int main() // main function - it is the entry point of a c++ program
{ // scope of function
    cout << "Hello World\n"; // cout - it is an object of class iostream, it is used to print output to the console
    // << - it is an operator, it is used to send output to the console
    // ; - it is a statement terminator, it is used to mark the end of a statement
    // endl (escape sequence) (\n) - it is a manipulator, it is used to insert a new line and flush the output buffer
